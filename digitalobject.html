    <div class="paraDiv">
        <p> Google processes roughly 8.5 billion searches daily– that is around 99,000 searches per second and about 2 trillion searches annually. The average person conducts 3-4 searches daily, and it is estimated that hundreds of millions of people use Google everyday. This essay will explore Google Search as a digital object through a formalist lens, using the texts The Language of New Media by Lev Manovich and Software Studies : A Lexicon by Matthew Fuller to situate it within digital and new media theory, evaluating also whether formalism is enough for a critical analysis despite the missing socio-political context that grounds the digital object in the real world. 
            To begin with, we can establish the lens being used– Formalism is a critical approach that focuses on the analysis of the form of it’s subject, as opposed to it’s content. In this way it takes a more purely technical or structural view that ignores context and history, prioritizing effect over intent, the ‘what’ and the ‘how’ over the ‘why’.
            Based on this definition, we can take a formalist, technical look at the digital object being examined. Google Search is an automated search engine that works in three stages– crawling, indexing, and serving search results. The first stage, crawling, occurs using software called web crawlers that find extant web pages looking for new or updated content to add to their database, also called ‘URL discovery’. This automated process is used much more than manual submissions for site inclusions. It may also crawl the discovered pages to find out their content. The program used to fetch this data is called GoogleBot, and it uses an algorithmic process to decide which sites to crawl and how often, as well as how many pages to fetch from a particular site. It doesn’t crawl every site it comes across, this can be due to the site owner not giving it permission to crawl, sites that require log-ins for access, network issues, issues with the server that handles the site, and more. As part of the crawling process, Google uses rendering to view the page content, running the JavaScript it finds. 
            The second step, indexing, is when Google tries to understand what the page is about after crawling it. In it, the software processes the textual content and key content tags and attributes and analyzes them. It also checks whether the page is a duplicate or canonical, typically displaying the latter in search results. To make this distinction, it clusters pages that have similar content and selects the one that is most representative of the cluster. The remaining pages may be shown in different cases, for example if the search comes from a mobile device or a specific page from that cluster is being queried. It also picks up on signals about the canonical page, like the language, country, or usability. The data about the canonical page may be stored in the Google index, but it isn’t guaranteed, depending on factors like low page quality, the web design making indexing complicated, and more. 
            The third stage is the serving of the search results itself, occurring when a user enters a search query. The software looks through the index for relevant and high quality pages that match the search. Relevancy is determined factors like the location, language, and device of the search. The query also affects the search features that show up based on relevance to the search, like image results, local results, shopping results, and more. According to Google, it ranks the results based on meaning, relevance, quality, usability, and context, with the weight of each factor changing based on the search query.
            To properly look at the Google Search as a digital object, we need to understand what we mean by a digital object. The distinction between analog vs digital is that the analog represents information by using a continuous range of values, while digital renders information by having discrete values. To further explicate this, we can look at Fuller’s Software Studies : A Lexicon, which Formalistically exemplifies the way the digital functions and is therefore defined, 
            “Digital cameras sample light from a particular position, that of the lens. This involves converting the signal from the continuous light we see to the discrete quantities of light recorded in bitmaps […] Quantization, converting the amplitude of the signal from a continuous and infinite range of values to a finite set of discrete values, can be thought of as setting the bit-depth of the picture, establishing subtle or visibly discontinuous gradations of light […] each pixel has boundaries they require a process by which the world is chopped up into chunks that conform to those boundaries and is still visually meaningful. Discretization is part of the process by which color and light values are allocated to a pixel. It consists of sorting values, evaluating a cut-point where a value changes or merges, and setting the intervals between samples and value setting.” (Fuller, 215).
            
            In his example of the way digital cameras covert continuous light to discrete pixels, he establishes the quality of digitalness through identifying it’s facets of ‘quantization’ and ‘discretization’. This requirement is filled by the Google Search, by virtue of it being coded. Programming languages are classified as high-level, made easier for humans to understand and therefore abstracted from the pure code that the computer interprets, or low-level, which is closer to the computer in the conversions required for it to be understood by the computer. Binary code, which is the foundation of computing is considered the lowest-level programming language, and is therefore a good representation of how code is discrete, as supported by Fuller’s example. It discretizes data into ‘bits’, 0s and 1s, sending signals to the computer to switch on or off at the most minute levels to construct larger patterns. This code is the hidden base of the code that makes up Google Search, the last conversion from the code managed by software developers to the code directly interpreted by the computer.
            To complicate the way Google Search is situated in digital and media theory, we can take a look at Manovich’s The Language of New Media, where a more specific Formalist distinction is drawn– between new and old media. The media theorist defines new media primarily through five principles, namely, numerical representation, modularity, automation, variability, and transcoding. He delineates numerical representation by writing,  
            “All new media objects, whether created from scratch on computers or converted from analog media sources, are composed of digital code; they are numerical representations. This fact has two key consequences:
            1.    A new media object can be described formally (mathematically). For instance, an image or a shape can be described using a mathematical function.
            2.    A new media object is subject to algorithmic manipulation. For instance, by applying appropriate algorithms, we can automatically remove "noise" from a photograph, improve its contrast, locate the edges of the shapes, or change its proportions. In short, media becomes programmable.” (Manovich, 27).
            
            As established, Google Search is digital, and therefore a numerical representation as seen in this definition by Manovich. Additionally, it is also subject to algorithmic manipulation, and is programmable, using these to function. 
            Manovich then addresses the principle of modularity, writing, 
            “Just as a fractal has the same structure on different scales, a new media object has the same modular structure throughout. Media elements, be they images, sounds, shapes, or behaviors, are represented as collections of discrete samples (pixels, polygons, voxels, characters, scripts). These elements are assembled into larger-scale objects but continue to maintain their separate identities. The objects chemselves can be combined into even larger objects– again, without losing their independence.” (Manovich, 30).
            
            This feature of new media describes how it’s structure echoes itself from it’s components to it’s clusters, separate elements each made up of smaller elements that are themselves clusters of smaller independent elements. This is seen in the chosen digital object as well– the code contains individual but complex functions and elements that strung together make arguments and algorithms. 
            Manovich expounds upon automation by writing, “The numerical coding of media (principle 1) and the modular structure of a media object (principle 2) allow for the automation of many operations involved in media creation, manipulation, and access. Thus human intentionality can be removed from the creative process, at least in part.” (Manovich, 32). As seen, Google Search uses automation throughout it’s various stages, for example, web and page crawling, and search result ranking.
            Next, he develops the principle of variability, noting that, 
            “A new media object is not something fixed once and for all, but something that can exist in different, potentially infinite versions. [...] Instead of identical copies, a new media object typically gives rise to many different versions. And rather than being created completely by a human author, these versions are often in part automatically assembled by a computer. (The example of Web pages automatically generated from databases using templates created by Web designers can be invoked here as well.)” (Manovich, 36).
            
            This idea of an automated, modular object that can be assembled and reassembled infinitely applies perfectly to Google Search. As seen, it transforms automatically in accordance to the search query, modularly varying its output by changing the content and order of the results.
            Lastly, he develops his idea of transcoding, writing, 
            “The fifth and last principle of cultural transcoding aims to describe what in my view is the most substantial consequence of the computerization of media. As I have suggested, computerization turns media into computer data. While from one point of view, computerized media still displays structural organization that makes sense to its human users-images feature recognizable objects; text files consist of grammatical sentences; virtual spaces are defined along the familiar Cartesian coordinate system; and so on-from another point of view, its structure now follows the established conventions of the computer's organization of data. Examples of these conventions are different data structures such as lists, records, and arrays; the already-mentioned substitution of all constants by variables; the separation between algorithms and data structures; and modularity.” (Manovich, 45). 
            
            
            This principle seems to refer to the way new media is an interaction between the computer and the human, an interface that holds both languages and meaning simultaneously, each influencing the other. This is highlighted by the interactiveness and customization offered by the Google Search. You type your query and get results, which you parse and click through, which in turn influences the programme that you called when you searched, changing the algorithm forever.  
            Through Fuller’s and Manovich’s Formalist understanding of digitalness and theories on media, we can safely classify the Google Search as a digital object, particularly as a new media digital object. However, as hinted at by Manovich’s final principle, the nature of new media and digital objects as being the product of an interaction between the computer and the human, tangible in addition to virtual, and even moreso as culturally and scorpio-politically influenced as well as influential, emphasizes the gap that appears through a purely Formalist analysis. The Google Search is not infallible, and it’s intensely integrated use in society– transcended to cyborg heights– begs an analysis of how it affects and is affected by it’s cultural context– all impacting and impacted by the existence of the pages, the ranking of the results, the content highlighted by generative AI, the placement of the advertisements. In this vein, i would ask the following non-formalist questions in order to examine the content that the Google Search returns to users in order to critically and thoroughly examine it:
            Whose pages are highlighted by the algorithm ranking and why?
            Are advertisements ethical in a search engine that people use as an extension of their brain?
            To what extent should generative AI play a part in the search results we see?
            How does the language that the generative AI uses affect the user, for example, the confidence it has in it’s generated answer?
